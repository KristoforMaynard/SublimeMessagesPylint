SublimeMessagesPylint
=====================

Yet another plugin for pylint in Sublime Text. Unlike others, this one has a brittish accent. The main difference is this plugin works with the SublimeMessages plugin.

The prerequisits for this plugin are:
 - SublimeMessages plugin
 - pylint version >= 1.0.1

Much of the inspiriation for this plugin comes from the pylinter plugin, but with an effort to make it a bit more natural. For instance, when you edit a file, and marked lines move, the gutter marks move with them.
